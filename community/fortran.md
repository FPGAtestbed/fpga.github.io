## Fortran-HLS

In the paper _Fortran High-Level Synthesis: Reducing the barriers to accelerating HPC codes on FPGAs_, Gabriel Rodriguez-Canal, supervised by Nick Brown, both from EPCC integrated Fortran with HLS as part of an internship with HPE in collaboration with Tim Dykes, Jess Jones, and Utz-Uwe Haus. This enables HPC programmers to directly program FPGAs using Fortran and avoids an initial, time consuming first step of converting the code into C++. Due to the ubiquity of Fortran in HPC, we believe that this will significantly lower the burden to accelerating HPC codes on the technology. This paper was presented at the [33rd International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications](https://2023.fpl.org/).
