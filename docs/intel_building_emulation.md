## Intel Building and Emulation

The building of codes for the physical FPGA chips is a time consuming process. Firstly it is useful to have a powerful system for undertaking the actual build process, which is the case for this testbed, and also vendors provide emulation support such that users can much more quickly build and test their codes on the CPU without having to do the full build for the FPGA.
