## Applying for access

Access to the FPGA testbed is free for scientific and engieering workloads. There are two steps required for accessing the system, firstly we need to approve your access and secondly you will need to sign up to the system.

### Step one, access approval
You should first send an email to [fpga-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk](mailto:fpga-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk?subject=Access%20enquiry) giving a brief description of who you are, your institution affiliation and what you are planning to use the FPGA testbed for (e.g. what codes you are interested in accelerating). There are two purposes to this step, firstly ensuring that users are utilising the system appropriately but also we are able to offer software support.

### Step two, apply for access via SAFE
You should only do this step after receiving a reply from the previous step. The machine is managed by SAFE, and to request an account you should visit [https://webapps.epcc.ed.ac.uk/](https://webapps.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) and sign up. This is a two stage process, you first sign up for a web account, and once that is created go into SAFE and click _Login accounts_ and _Request login account_. Enter the project code _nx08_ and request an account on _hydra-vpn_. You should then repeat this process requesting an account on _NextgenIO_ , the usernames you select for both these machines can be the same.

Once you have applied for an account it typically takes a few hours for it to be created and you will be emailed with further details.
