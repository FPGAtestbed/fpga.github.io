## FPGAs for HPC

This testbed provides HPC code developers and data-scientists with access to the latest data centre Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in order to experiment with exploiting this hardware for accelerating their codes. In addition to the FPGA nodes themselves, the machine will also contain the required toolchains and licences pre-installed as well as hardware for building and testing FPGA codes before deployment to the FPGAs themselves.

We will also have numerous memory technologies, including HBM and NV-RAM, on the FPGAs which developers can experiment with for use in their workloads.

### Coming soon!

The testbed will open for access in late May 2021 and access will be free, we are currently busy developing documentation which will also go live on this website in May. If you would like more information at this stage, or to be notified when access is possible, then email [fpga-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk](mailto:fpga-testbed@mlist.is.ed.ac.uk?subject=Website%20enquiry)
